# CPM: Color-Pattern Makeup Transfer

| ![teaser.png](./imgs/teaser.png) | 
|:--:| 
| **CPM** (Color-Pattern Makeup Transfer) is the a holistic makeup transfer model that can **replicate both colors and patterns** from a reference makeup style to another image. |

This is the official implementation of the CVPR'21 paper: 

**Lipstick ain't enough: Beyond Color Matching for In-the-Wild Makeup Transfer**. \
T. Nguyen, A. Tran, M. Hoai (2021) \
IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).




*Although the main part of the code has been uploaded, we're still fixing some minor bugs. If you have trouble running the code, please read [Trouble Shooting](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/CPM#trouble-shooting) first before [creating an issue](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/CPM/issues). Thank you ðŸŒ±*

### Getting Started

##### Requirements

``` diff
- Need to specify some presequisites such as cuda version 
```

##### Installation

``` sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/VinAIResearch/CPM.git
cd CPM

# install dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


##### Download pre-trained models

- Download Makeup pretrained models from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dagiuultGgDd_QNikMTrNlmCmWEaFV_N?usp=sharing). They are `pattern.pth` and `color.pth`. Put them in `checkpoints` folder.

- Download [PRNet pretrained model] from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UoE-XuW1SDLUjZmJPkIZ1MLxvQFgmTFH/view). Put it in `PRNet/net-data`

##### Usage

```sh
# Color+Pattern: 
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --style ./imgs/style-1.png --input ./imgs/non-makeup.png

# Color Only: 
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --style ./imgs/style-1.png --input ./imgs/non-makeup.png --color_only

# Pattern Only: 
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --style ./imgs/style-1.png --input ./imgs/non-makeup.png --pattern_only
```

Result image will be saved in `result.png` (style | original image | result). You can try other styles `style-2.png`, `style-3.png`, etc.

``` diff
- Can you please include some sample input and output images: (style, input, output, output_color-only, output_pattern-only)? This would be useful for people to verify that they have installed your code successfuly. 
```

### Datasets

We introduce âœ¨ 4 new datasets: CPM-Real, CPM-Synt-1, CPM-Synt-2, and Stickers datasets. Besides, we also use published [LADN's Dataset](https://georgegu1997.github.io/LADN-project-page/) & [Makeup Transfer Dataset](http://liusi-group.com/projects/BeautyGAN).

Please refer to [readme-about-data.md](./readme-about-data.md) for downloading these datasets.

``` diff
- Perhaps it is find to have a separate file for data, but I suggest merging it to this main page as well. First, it is quite short. Second, it will make this page look more comprehensive. Third, being exposed in the front page, the datasets have higher chance of being used. 

```

### Training and Evaluation


As stated in the paper, the Color Branch and Pattern Branch are totally independent. Yet, they shared the same workflow:

1. Data preparation: Use [PRNet](https://github.com/YadiraF/PRNet) to generate texture_map of faces.
1. Training

Please redirect to [***Color Branch***](./Color) or [***Pattern Branch***](./Pattern) for further details.


### Trouble Shooting

1. [Solved] `ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`:
	```
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-glx
	```
1. [Solved] `RuntimeError: Expected tensor for argument #1 'input' to have the same device as tensor for argument #2 'weight'; but device 1 does not equal 0 (while checking arguments for cudnn_convolution)`
	Add CUDA VISIBLE DEVICES before .py. Ex: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py`
